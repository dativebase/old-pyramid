  The Online Linguistic Database (OLD)
================================================================================

.. image:: OLD-logo.png
   :align: left

The Online Linguistic Database (OLD) is software for linguistic fieldwork. It
helps groups of linguists, language documenters, and/or language community
members to collaboratively build a web-accessible database of their language
data.


Features
================================================================================

- Multi-user database creation
- Advanced search
- Automatic morpheme cross-referencing
- Configurable validation
- Morphological parser & phonology builder
- Text creation
- User access control
- Documentation
- Open source
- Graphical User Interface: Dative
- RESTful JSON API

For additional information, see the `OLD Web Site`_.

`Dative`_ is a GUI for the OLD. See the `Dative source code`_, `Dative's web
site`_, or the `Dative app`_ for more information.


Deployment
===============================================================================

Deploying the OLD means:

1. downloading its source code and installing it, including its Python
   dependencies;
2. installing its operating system dependencies (e.g., Ffmpeg, foma);
3. making configuration decisions, e.g., the name of the MySQL database to use;
4. creating its database tables and needed directory structure; and
5. serving it.


Development Deployment using Docker Compose
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The recommended way of creating a full DativeBase (i.e., Dative and OLD)
development deployment is by following the `DativeBase Docker Compose
instructions`_.


Deploying locally using Vagrant and Ansible
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The OLD and Dative can also be installed locally for development purposes on a
virtual machine using the `Dative/OLD Vagrant/Ansible deploy scripts`_::

    $ git clone git@github.com:dativebase/deploy-dative-old.git
    $ cd deploy-dative-old/playbooks/dative-old
    $ ansible-galaxy install -f -p roles/ -r requirements.yml
    $ vagrant up

If the above works, you should see something like the following::

    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
    dative-old-local           : ok=84   changed=31   unreachable=0    failed=0

And Dative and the OLD should be accessible at the following URLs:

- Dative at http://192.169.169.192:8000
- OLD instance #1 at http://192.169.169.192/testold/
- OLD instance #2 at http://192.169.169.192/testold2/

The above commands assume you have Vagrant (>= 1.7) installed and Ansible (v.
2.1.1.0) installed. These commands will install the OLD and its dependencies
(foma, MITLM, ffmpeg, TGrep2) on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 14.04; they
will configure and serve two OLD instances as well as the Dative GUI. More
details are available at
https://github.com/dativebase/deploy-dative-old/tree/master/playbooks/dative-old.


Building and running the OLD in a Docker container
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build the OLD docker image::

    $ docker build -t dativebase/old .

Run the old container and launch a bash sell inside it::

    $ docker run -it dativebase/old bash
    #

Confirm that Python 3.6, Ffmpeg, foma, TGrep2, and MITLM are installed::

    # python3.6 -V
    Python 3.6.3
    # ffmpeg -version
    ffmpeg version 3.4.1-1~16.04.york0 Copyright (c) 2000-2017 the FFmpeg developers
    # foma -v
    foma 0.9.18alpha
    # tgrep2 -h
    TGrep2 version 1.15
    # estimate-ngram -h
    MIT Language Modeling Toolkit 0.4.2


Installation
===============================================================================

To install the OLD manually from source, create and activate a Python3 virtual
environment, clone the OLD source, and use pip to install its dependencies::

    $ virtualenv -p /path/to/python3/executable env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ git clone git@github.com:dativebase/old-pyramid.git
    $ cd old-pyramid
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt -e .


Build the Database Tables
===============================================================================

You must manually create the MySQL database that you expect to use for each OLD
instance. Here is an example (which assumes a pre-existing user named ``old``)::

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE old DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_bin;
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON old.* TO 'old'@'localhost';

After installing the OLD, the `initialize_old` executable should be in your
PATH. Calling it will create the database tables, add some default values
(e.g., default users), and will create the directory structure scaffolding::

    $ initialize_old config.ini

To control the configuration (e.g., the database user, password, host, etc.)
you can modify the config file ``config.ini`` or, better yet, use environment
variables (see below).


Serve the OLD
===============================================================================

You can use `pserve`_ to serve the OLD::

    $ pserve config.ini

Alternatively, use the serve.sh convenience shell script, providing host and
port values as environment variables, if desired::

    $ OLD_PORT=62008 ./serve.sh

Now if you navigate to http://localhost:62008/old/ you should see a big JSON
object that describes the OLD's API. If you install `Dative`_, you can use it to
interact with the OLD.


Environment Variable Configuration
===============================================================================

Serving the OLD and building its database tables requires configuration which
can come from directly modifying the config file (config.ini) or from setting
specific environment variables. The latter approach is recommended and the
following environment variables are recognized by the OLD. See the comments in
the config file for what is expected in these variables.

-  ``OLD_DB_RDBMS``
-  ``OLD_DB_USER``
-  ``OLD_DB_PASSWORD``
-  ``OLD_DB_HOST``
-  ``OLD_DB_PORT``
-  ``OLD_DB_DIRPATH``
-  ``SQLALCHEMY_POOL_RECYCLE``
-  ``OLD_NAME_TESTS``
-  ``OLD_TESTING``
-  ``OLD_CREATE_REDUCED_SIZE_FILE_COPIES``
-  ``OLD_PREFERRED_LOSSY_AUDIO_FORMAT``
-  ``OLD_PERMANENT_STORE``
-  ``OLD_ADD_LANGUAGE_DATA``
-  ``OLD_EMPTY_DATABASE``
-  ``OLD_PASSWORD_RESET_SMTP_SERVER``
-  ``OLD_TEST_EMAIL_TO``
-  ``OLD_GMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS``
-  ``OLD_GMAIL_FROM_PASSWORD``
-  ``OLD_SESSION_TYPE``
-  ``OLD_SESSION_URL``
-  ``OLD_SESSION_DATA_DIR``
-  ``OLD_SESSION_LOCK_DIR``
-  ``OLD_SESSION_KEY``
-  ``OLD_SESSION_SECRET``
-  ``OLD_SESSION_COOKIE_EXPIRES``



Technical
================================================================================

The OLD is software for creating OLD instances, RESTful web services that send
and receive data in JSON format. It is written in Python using the `Pyramid web
framework`_. It works with both MySQL and SQLite as the RDBMS.

Note: this is the OLD written using the `Pyramid`_ framework and is the version
that will be used for current and future development. For the `Pylons`_
framework OLD, see the `Pylons OLD source`_ and the `Official OLD
Documentation`_.


Run the Tests
================================================================================

To run tests you must have MySQL v. 5.6 or greater installed. (The tests are
not guaranteed to pass currently with SQLite or earlier versions of MySQL.) If
MySQL is installed, make sure that the MySQL database and user corresponding to
your configuration exist. For example, if your testing configuration expects a
database named ``oldtests`` accessible to the user ``old`` with password
``demo``, do the following::

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE oldtests
        DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8
        DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_bin;
    mysql> CREATE USER 'old'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'demo';
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON oldtests.* TO 'old'@'localhost';

Make sure that your configuration matches your test database, i.e., modify the
config file to have appropriate corresponding values, e.g., ``db.user = old``,
or, better yet, set the corresponding environment variables e.g.,
``OLD_DB_USER=old``. Also, make sure to turn testing on in the configuration:
``OLD_TESTING=1``.

Then run the tests::

    $ pytest

The convenience script test.sh will turn testing on for you and will then run
the tests::

    $ ./test.sh

The tests can also be run with tox using specific Python versions::

    $ tox -e py34
    $ tox -e py35
    $ tox -e py36

To run all tests across all supported Python versions, including the pylint
linting tests::

    $ tox

# ==============================================================================
# OLD Configuration
# ==============================================================================
#
# The default settings provided here should work for production deployments of
# the OLD. All of these configuration settings should be overridable by
# environment variables; the equivalent environment variables (with alternative
# values) are given in comments above the relevant settings, e.g., OLD_DB_USER.
#
# See http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.7-branch/narr/environment.html


# OLD App config
# ==============================================================================

[app:main]
use = egg:old

#[filter:translogger]
#use = egg:Paste#translogger

#[pipeline:main]
#pipeline = translogger
#           old


# Pyramid config
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When this value is true, templates are automatically reloaded whenever they
# are modified without restarting the application, so you can see changes to
# templates take effect immediately during development. Not really relevant to
# the OLD as templates are not used.
# PYRAMID_RELOAD_TEMPLATES=1
pyramid.reload_templates = false

# Print view-related NotFound debug messages to stderr when this value is true.
# PYRAMID_DEBUG_NOTFOUND=1
pyramid.debug_notfound = false

# Print debugging messages related to url dispatch route matching when this
# value is true.
# PYRAMID_DEBUG_ROUTEMATCH=1
pyramid.debug_routematch = false

# PYRAMID_DEFAULT_LOCALE_NAME=de
pyramid.default_locale_name = en

# The debug toolbar should not be used in production. To use it in development,
# uncomment the following line.
# pyramid.includes = pyramid_debugtoolbar


# Beaker sessions config
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Beaker is used to store sessions across requests in order to implement
# authentication and authorization. See
# - http://beaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html
# - https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_beaker/en/latest/

# Back-end type: ext:database. Since multiple OLD processes (potentially
# on different machines) can be collectively serving requests to multiple
# distinct OLD instances (dbs), the back-end used must be an external database
# (or we could use MongoDB or Redis...).
# OLD_SESSION_TYPE was ext:database
session.type = file

# Beaker session URL. This is left empty because the default behaviour is to
# use the same database that stores the OLD data, i.e., the value of the
# 'sqlalchemy.url' key, which is generated in old/__init__.py. The table name
# created by Beaker should be 'beaker_cache'. TODO: this env var is being
# overridden universally so is there any point to having it?
# OLD_SESSION_URL
session.url =

# This is only needed for file-type sessions.
# OLD_SESSION_DATA_DIR
session.data_dir = %(here)s\data\sessions\data

# Used with every back-end, to coordinate locking. With caching, this lock file
# is used to ensure that multiple processes/threads aren't attempting to
# re-create the same value at the same time (The Dog-Pile Effect).
# The OLD modifies this value on a per-request basis by appending the OLD
# instance name (which is parsed from the URL) to this directory.
# OLD_SESSION_LOCK_DIR
session.lock_dir = %(here)s\data\sessions\lock

# Name of the cookie key used to save the session under. As with the lock_dir
# value, the OLD modifies this value on a per-request basis by appending the OLD
# instance name (which is parsed from the URL) to this directory.
# OLD_SESSION_KEY
session.key = old

# Beaker session key. Used with the HMAC to ensure session integrity. This
# value should ideally be a randomly generated string. When using in a cluster
# environment, the secret must be the same on every machine.
# OLD_SESSION_SECRET
session.secret = db49238825c4409897b39f49f29e4d77

# Beaker session cookie expires. Determines when the cookie used to track the
# client-side of the session will expire. When set to a boolean value, it will
# either expire at the end of the browsers session, or never expire.
# OLD_SESSION_COOKIE_EXPIRES
session.cookie_expires = true


# SQLAlchemy config
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Instead of using the sqlalchemy.url configuration setting as is normal for a
# Pyramid application, (e.g., ``sqlalchemy.url =
# mysql+oursql://<user>:<password>@<host>[:<port>]/<dbname>``), the OLD
# requires that the components of that setting be provided individually, either
# in this config file or via environment variables. See below.
# A single OLD process can be used to serve requests against multiple logically
# distinct OLD instances (i.e., database / file system path pairs), depending on
# the prefix of the URL path. All of these MySQL databases must be at the same
# host/port and accessible to the same MySQL user.

# Default is mysql, but sqlite should also work.
# OLD_DB_RDBMS
db.rdbms = sqlite

# OLD_DB_USER
db.user = old

# OLD_DB_PASSWORD
db.password = demo

# OLD_DB_HOST
db.host = localhost

# OLD_DB_PORT
db.port = 3306

# This should be the name of the OLD instance (database and directory name) to
# use when running the tests.
# OLD_NAME_TESTS
old_name_tests = oldtests

# This should be the name of the second OLD instance (database and directory
# name) to use when running tests that require 2 OLD instances.
# OLD_NAME_2_TESTS
old_name_2_tests = oldtests2

# This is required if SQLite is being used. It should be a full path to the
# directory where the SQLite database file is (should be) located.
# OLD_DB_DIRPATH
db.dirpath = ${OLD_PERMANENT_STORE}\dbs

# See http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/pooling.html.
# SQLALCHEMY_POOL_RECYCLE
sqlalchemy.pool_recycle = 3600


# General OLD config
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Set this to 1 if the tests are being run.
# OLD_TESTING
testing = 0

# Permanent Store: for storing binary files for corpora, files, users,
# phonologies, etc. In the default case, these files will be under a
# subdirectory of permanent_store with the name being the value of
# ``old/lib/constants.py::OLD_NAME_DFLT``, i.e., 'old'. When the OLD being
# served is not 'old', the files will be stored in a subdirectory of
# permanent_store named after that OLD.
# OLD_PERMANENT_STORE
permanent_store = ${HERE}\oldinstances

# Add Language Data: boolean indicating whether or not ISO 639-3 language data
# will be entered when initializing the database. Used in
# old/scripts/initializedb.py.
# OLD_ADD_LANGUAGE_DATA
add_language_data = 1

# Empty Database: set this to 1 if you want calls to
# old/scripts/initializedb.py to have no effect on the database.
# OLD_EMPTY_DATABASE
empty_database = 0

# Create reduced size file copies: set this to 0 if you do not want the system
# to create copies of images and .wav files with reduced sizes.  Default is 1
# (i.e, true).
# OLD_CREATE_REDUCED_SIZE_FILE_COPIES
create_reduced_size_file_copies = 1

# For preferred_lossy_audio_format choose one of 'ogg' (Ogg Vorbis) or 'mp3'.
# Default is 'ogg'. If mp3 is chosen and ffmpeg cannot encode mp3, ogg will be
# used instead.
# OLD_PREFERRED_LOSSY_AUDIO_FORMAT
preferred_lossy_audio_format = ogg


# Emails
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When sending "password reset" emails, the system will use the hostname
# specified as password_reset_smtp_server or the corresponding environment variable.
# If password_reset_smtp_server is 'smtp.gmail.com', then Gmail will be used to
# send the email. In that case, the Gmail from address and password are
# required as environment variables.

# OLD_PASSWORD_RESET_SMTP_SERVER
password_reset_smtp_server = localhost

# Test email TO. Specify a test_email_to value **only** if you want to override
# the recipient email with a given value in all reset-password-via-email TEST
# requests.
# OLD_TEST_EMAIL_TO
test_email_to =

# Valuate these environment variables if 'smtp.gmail.com' is the value of
# password_reset_smtp_server. Do **not** save these in the config file.

# OLD_GMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS
# gmail_from_address

# OLD_GMAIL_FROM_PASSWORD
# gmail_from_password
